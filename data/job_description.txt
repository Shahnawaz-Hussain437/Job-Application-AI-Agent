Essae-Teraoka is developing a next-gen smart retail weighing scale that uses AI and computer vision to automatically identify produce, eliminating the need for manual PLU codes or barcode scanning. We’re seeking an AI/ML Engineer to join our lean, high-impact R&D team. You’ll own and deploy models that run entirely offline on edge devices, targeting a top-1 accuracy of ≥95%, a latency of less than 500 ms, and a footprint of less than 500 MB.
This is a ground-up opportunity to build real-world, production-grade AI for a flagship product that has the potential to revolutionise checkout experiences across India.

Key Responsibilities
• Develop, train, prune, and quantise CNN-based models (e.g., EfficientNet, MobileNet) for fine-grained classification.
• Implement XLDA-style augmentation pipelines and address class imbalance to achieve variety-level accuracy.
• Optimise models for dual deployment targets:
o Edge-A: Rockchip RK3568 using RKNN Toolkit 2.
o Edge-B: Intel Atom N97 using OpenVINO 2024.
• Prototype and maintain a Siamese/triplet embedding head for ambiguous variety disambiguation.
• Collaborate on active learning, feedback loop retraining, and CI/CD pipelines for continuous improvement.
• Interface with embedded engineers to deploy real-time inference integrated with camera, weight sensor, and UI components.
• Contribute to fallback logic and top-3 suggestion UX to ensure reliability in low-confidence scenarios.

Minimum Qualifications
We’re looking for someone with a strong sense of ownership and a bias for action, someone who treats this project like their own startup and drives it forward with initiative and accountability.
• Solid Python skills with experience in PyTorch and ONNX workflows.
• Hands-on project or industry experience in image classification or fine-grained recognition.
• Familiarity with image preprocessing (OpenCV, Albumentations).
• Understanding of model optimisation techniques: quantisation, pruning, or knowledge distillation.
• Firm grasp of CNN architectures (EfficientNet, MobileNet, ResNet).
• Comfortable working on Linux systems and edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, or similar).

Preferred (Bonus) Skills
• Experience with OpenVINO or RKNN Toolkit 2.
• Knowledge of Siamese Networks, Triplet Loss, or embedding-based inference.
• Understanding of active learning, metric learning, or few-shot classification.
• Deployment experience on embedded Linux platforms (RK3568 or Intel Atom).
• Prior contributions to end-to-end computer vision pipelines in edge environments.

Why Join Us
• Lead cutting-edge AI deployment for real-world retail automation at a national scale.
• Work on hardware-software integration with ML, UX, and embedded teams.
• Shape the technical architecture of a product poised for broad deployment.
• Collaborate with market experts and industry consultants.
• Join a dynamic team where you can truly make an impact! Enjoy the chance to take strong ownership of your work, apply your skills in real-world situations, and experience rapid learning along the way.

Our Stack
• Core Frameworks: PyTorch, ONNX, OpenVINO, RKNN Toolkit 2
• Data Tools: Albumentations, DVC, MLflow
• Edge Platforms: Rockchip RK3568 (Linux + NPU), Intel Atom N97 (iGPU + OpenVINO)
• Languages: Python, Bash
• Version Control: Git
• MLOps: CI/CD + OTA updates via local gateway
